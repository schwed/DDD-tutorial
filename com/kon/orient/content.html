<!--the Load() method
As described in the previous chapter, there are many ways to use AJAX with jQuery,
and they should of course be used depending on the situation.
One of the simplest and yet still powerful methods for loading data asynchronously is the load() method.
You use it by selecting an element where you want the content loaded to and then call the load() method on it.
It takes the URL that you wish to load, as a parameter. For this example, we need a an external file that we can load.
We'll call it content.html and the content of it should look something like this:-->
<div id="divContent">
    <b>This is external content</b>
    This is the data to be return when jquery call get or post!
    It will be loaded by the callback.
</div>
